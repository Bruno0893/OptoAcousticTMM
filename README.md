# OptoAcousticTMM
Transfer matrix method to simulate acoustic and optical waves in heterostructures, it can calculate reflectivity curves and simulated pump and probe spectra.
## Available structure types
- **Superlattice** : standard heterostructure with a repeating unit cell
- **OpticalCavity**: confines optical modes, two DBR's with a spacer in between
- **Resonator**: confines acoustic modes, two DBR's with a spacer in between <br/>
**Note**: OpticalCavity and Resonator should be used with the same parameters to perform calculations with the photoelastic model
